Homework from course Optimization Methods in Beijing Institude of Technology. The course is given in chinese, hence report in chinese.
The course is enjoyable, fun and basically about swarm intelligence. 

Code is uploaded for potential further study. And I just don't want to lose such an interesting code because of buying new computer, which will be soon I guess.
